# Node-Basics-Website
A website to provide basic information about Node.

The whole point of this is simply to keep my skills working whilst I'm learning node, so the more Node I learn the more I can update this and hopefully by the end of it I will have a comphrensive SIMPLE guide for carrying out basic tasks/functions in Node.
